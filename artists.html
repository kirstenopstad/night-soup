        <p>Kirsten Opstad is a Los Angeles-based singer-songwriter. She has performed in legendary music venues, crowded living rooms, corners of art galleries, back rooms and cafes across the United States.</p>
        <p>Her most recent studio album Stay Strangers is a collection of original recordings created at Skeleton Studios and released by Teleportation. Produced and engineered by expert music technologist Jason Dragon and mixed by Platinum-selling Kraig Tyler, Stay Strangers is an intimate body of work which showcases the raw, emotional intensity of Kirsten's songwriting and performance.</p>
        <p>Other recordings include: the Moons series (Strawberry, Buck, Sturgeon, Harvest, Hunter & Frost); Sound I Make, an EP consisting of experimental writing/recording styles; Monday, Monday which includes selections of covers from a yearlong song-per-week project; Land of the Free, a collection of covers mixed at Skeleton Studios; Fear of Swimming, a collection of originals recorded at Interstellar Studios; Together We Fall Apart, a multi-artist covers compilation of break up songs; and Keep Your Stupid Moon, a collaboration with poet/musician StevIe Subrizi as The Crazy Exes from Hell.</p>

        <p>"Crazy Exes from Hell offer humor, energy, and lingering hooks that blister your brain as much as their honesty. [Their double-edged] vocals mingle and tell you the stories while raging acoustic guitars bash through pop progressions. If you've ever carried a 30 rack of PBR on your bike, fallen in love or felt the twitch of self loathing- this is the band for you." &#8212; Kristen Ford</p>
        <p>Kirsten Opstad and Stevie Subrizi began writing angry love songs together after they shared a bill at Midway Caf&eacute; in Jamaica Plain, MA, in the summer of 2010. You could say they sound like Violent Femmes performing Rodgers & Hammerstein. You could say they sound like The Moldy Peaches pulled a Fleetwood Mac. If you can get them in the same room together eight years after the dissolution of their band, don't do it. They'll probably just say curse words at each other, meaning them.</p>
