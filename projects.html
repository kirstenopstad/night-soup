        <p>To commemorate the ungracious passage of tens years since their first EP and to drive a final nail into the coffin of The Crazy Exes from Hell, the band released The Crazy Exes Anthology from Hell in Fall 2021.</p>
        <p>The collection includes remastered versions of the Crazy Exes' entire discography, including their rendition of Fleetwood Mac's "Go Your Own Way" (recorded for the Together We Fall Apart mixtape) and a fresh recording of "Carol for the Bitter at Heart," a song that they used to love to hate to play together that they never got around to recording until ten years after they broke up. </P>
        <P>To pair with the anthology, they collected archival footage of shows from all over the Northeast from the early 2010s and assembled a short documentary, available on <a href="https://vimeo.com/624735086">Vimeo</a>. </p>
        <h2>2020</h2>
        <iframe style="border: 0; width: 250px; height: 250px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2043070961/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/minimal=true/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="https://kirstenopstad.bandcamp.com/album/eclipse-3">Eclipse by Kirsten Opstad</a></iframe> 
        <p>Eclipse is an album forged in parallel. Together artists from Nashville, San Francisco, Boston, Los Angeles and Dover focused their quarantined energies to create something beautiful. In this collaborative compilation, artists from across the country reimagine and record songs from Kirsten Opstad's moons project.</p>
        <p>Moons, a collection of twenty-one songs released with six consecutive full moons last year, aimed to demystify the process of writing, recording and releasing music regularly. A natural next phase, Eclipse aims to build new bridges between artists, creating community through collaboration.</p>
